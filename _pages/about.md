Welcome to my website! I'm Pawel, a deep learning engineer with programming experience. In my work I like to explore AI capabilities in creative content creation. I'm also fascinated about the idea of TinyML and deploying machine learning solutions on embedded devices.

I am an alumni of an awesome double degree Master program - [EIT Digital Master School](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/) that offers scholarships for technical studies at top European universities with a minor degree in Entrepreneurship & Innovations. I have completed my degree at [University Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) and [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I also hold a Bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics obtained at [Wroclaw University of Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/).

In my free time I like to travel (35 countries visited so far, lived in 5), [collect random songs](https://open.spotify.com/user/1197831799), [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/pbudzyns) and [take pictures with my Nikon](https://pbudzyns.tumblr.com/).
